Thank you for downloading MFB for your server. I wanted to make you aware of one small known issue.

When logging into a server-based version of the game, you may see a message reading:
ERROR: [crafttweaker]: Error executing {[3400:crafttweaker]: staging/mods/enderutilies.zs: net/minecraft/client/resources/I18n}

Two important notes about this message:
1) It is only seen by those who have OP privliages on the server
2) It has no impact on the game. It is related to the Ender Utilites tooltips, but has no effect on gameplay.

Again, thank you for your interest in MFB.
